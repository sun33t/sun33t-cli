Suneet Misra - nodeJS Engineer

Hi! I'm a node developer from Liverpool, UK. I like building things with JavaScript and TypeScript and automating tasks by creating CLIs.

Within my current role I'm using Node, TypeScript, React, NextJS, TDD, Storybook, Figma, mono-repo architecture and paired programming. I love collaboration and consider myself a life-long learner with a growth mindset which helps to keep me curious. I love sharing my knowledge with my colleagues as well as learning new things from them in turn! If you're interested in connecting with me, you can find me at:
